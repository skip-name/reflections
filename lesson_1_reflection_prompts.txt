How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I can see differences more directly

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    see mistakes and how things changed, recover old versions

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I can make changes at my schedule and capture steps I took to get to a place in the project.
    I have to be more disciplined to make more changes more often

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple files are for project orientation.  In code multiple files could be changed to make a complete change to the project

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log can show the history of changes at a more abstract level and git diff can see the details of the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    smaller development steps and tests can make it easier to find the problems

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
