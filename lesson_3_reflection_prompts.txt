When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
use this when sharing with others or when working from multiple computers
This is a good souce for remote backup and storage

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork is a clone from github account to github account, clone is a copy of a repository, branches are changes to repositories

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can run off line making changes then commit when back on line

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?
zip up files and send them to the other person

 What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 right now I think using github is much harder.  it is currently counter intuitive and very clumsy.
